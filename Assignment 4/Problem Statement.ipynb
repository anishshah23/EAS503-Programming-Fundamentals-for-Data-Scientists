    "Recall the Chicago Crime Data that was used in HW3. In this HW you are provided with 3 data files namely `chicago_crime_data_1.csv`, `chicago_crime_data_2.csv` and `primary_type_id.csv`.  The `chicago_crime_data_1.csv` contains data pertaing to the details of the crime and the `chicago_crime_data_2.csv` has information about the location and type. Both the datasets have the Crime ID as the primary indicator. \n",
